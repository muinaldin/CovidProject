# CovidProject

Crunching some statistics on COVID-19. All data was taken from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths on 22-01-2025. 

The CovidProject.sql file contains the code for creating the relevant tables from the raw imports I made, as well as queries stored as views. Originally the queries were based on the raw imports of the csv files, but the import wizard did not do a good enough job of cleaning the data up, so I extracted the relevant data into new tables and based the queries and views on those.
